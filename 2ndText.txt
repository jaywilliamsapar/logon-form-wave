If you want to have a separate copy of the cloned repository, you can simply create a new repository in your GitHub account and then push the cloned repository to the new repository.

Here are the steps to create a new repository and push the cloned repository to it:

Log in to your GitHub account and click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page.
Select "New repository" from the drop-down menu.
Give your new repository a name and select whether it should be public or private.
Click on the "Create repository" button to create the new repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
Type the following command in the terminal: git remote -v. This will show you the current remote URL for the cloned repository.
Type the following command to change the remote URL to the new repository you just created: git remote set-url origin [new repository URL], where [new repository URL] is the URL for the new repository you just created.
Type the following command to push the cloned repository to the new repository: git push -u origin master.
Your cloned repository should now be pushed to the new repository you created in your GitHub account.
Note: You can replace "master" with any other branch name if you are working on a different branch.
